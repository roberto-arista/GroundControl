#Ground Control
##Script for Robofont

### Principle
At first, I started writing this script only to have a window in which I could display glyphs, words or text set while I’m working on several fonts (for instance, masters of a family). In the process, I was suggested that being able to modify tracking might be interesting given the overview. So it came that I added a few more features to make the window a bit more useful (at least in my workflow). 

### Basic functionality
+ Opens a window in which are displayed all open fonts (up to 9)
+ You can input text that is simultaneously set on each line of type drawn by the script
+ Then, on each line separately, you can modify tracking, display options (show metrics, white on black, upside down) and send the current font in a space center window to modify spacing.
+ On each line, you can switch between any open font, at any time.
+ Ultimately, you can also apply global tracking, and each, global and local tracking can be applied in an additive way. To put it simply: you get what you see.

### Further functionality
Eventually, I’d like to extend the capabilities of the script and give more flexibility to the user about how many fonts/lines are displayed and allow to take out or add fonts dynamically (for the time being, you have to manage with opened, and closed fonts… not ideal, but hey, it’s a start).
